Problems encountered: <br>
Container for the form was created early on. So all elements for a books entry
was coded early. But I did not code the div slide in during this time. Now, trying
to add a slide in animation seems impossible. One of the important aspect of
sliding div is that the div and its elements must be 'crushed in'. <br>

Solutions to problem above found. Use a slider with all the elements preserved.
But this solution makes the div width not follow the width of leftBar. The answer
to this was the use of variables in CSS. Values calculated and placed as width
for the sliding div. <br>
