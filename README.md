Problems encountered:
Container for the form was created early on. So all elements for a books entry
was coded early. But I did not code the div slide in during this time. Now, trying
to add a slide in animation seems impossible. One of the important aspect of
sliding div is that the div and its elements must be 'crushed in'.
